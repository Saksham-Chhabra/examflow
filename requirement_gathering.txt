REQUIREMENT GATHERING
Automatic Datesheet Generation System

1. INTRODUCTION
The Automatic Datesheet Generation System is a campus-level application designed
to automate the process of preparing examination datesheets. Traditionally,
datesheets are created manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors
such as exam clashes and improper slot allocation. This system aims to simplify
and automate the process by collecting required academic and examination data
from the administrator and generating a valid datesheet automatically.

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Manual preparation of exam datesheets often leads to:
- Overlapping exams for students
- Inefficient time slot usage
- Difficulty in handling multiple programs and years
- Delays in publishing and updating schedules

The system addresses these issues by automating datesheet generation using
predefined rules and constraints.

3. STAKEHOLDERS
The main stakeholders involved in the system are:
- Administrator (Examination Cell)
- Faculty Members
- Students

4. USER ROLES IDENTIFIED

4.1 Administrator
The administrator is responsible for managing and controlling the entire
datesheet generation process.

4.2 Faculty
Faculty members are responsible for viewing exam schedules related to their
subjects.

4.3 Students
Students are end users who view and download their exam datesheets.

5. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS IDENTIFIED

FR1: Admin Authentication
The system should allow only authorized administrators to log in and access
the datesheet generation module.

FR2: Academic Information Collection
The system should allow the administrator to enter academic details such as:
- Programs (B.Tech, M.Tech, etc.)
- Academic years (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)
- Semesters

FR3: Subject and Course Information
The system should collect subject-related information including subject name,
subject code, and associated program and semester.

FR4: Exam Information Collection
The system should allow the administrator to enter:
- Exam type (Mid-term, End-term)
- Exam duration
- Available time slots
- Date range for exams

FR5: Constraint Definition
The system should allow the administrator to define constraints such as:
- No overlapping exams for the same year or semester
- Minimum gap between exams
- Fixed duration for exams

FR6: Automatic Datesheet Generation
The system should automatically generate an exam datesheet based on the
provided academic information and constraints.

FR7: Clash Detection
The system should detect any exam clashes and resolve them automatically
before finalizing the datesheet.

FR8: Datesheet Preview
The system should allow the administrator to preview the generated datesheet
before approval.

FR9: Datesheet Approval and Publishing
The system should allow the administrator to approve and publish the final
datesheet.

FR10: Datesheet Viewing
The system should allow faculty and students to view the published datesheet
based on their role and academic details.

6. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS IDENTIFIED

NFR1: Security
The system should ensure secure login and role-based access control.

NFR2: Performance
The system should generate datesheets within an acceptable time limit.

NFR3: Reliability
The system should ensure that the generated datesheet is consistent and
clash-free.

NFR4: Usability
The system should be easy to use and understandable by non-technical users.

NFR5: Scalability
The system should support multiple programs, years, and semesters.

7. DATA REQUIREMENTS
The system needs to store the following data:
- Administrator details
- Program and academic structure
- Subjects and courses
- Exam schedules and time slots
- Generated datesheets

8. ASSUMPTIONS
- Each subject has only one exam per academic session.
- All exams follow predefined time slots.
- Students belong to a single program and semester.

9. CONCLUSION
The requirement gathering phase identifies the system users, functional and
non-functional requirements, constraints, and data needs. These requirements
form the foundation for system design, ER diagrams, and implementation.
