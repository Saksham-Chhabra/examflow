PROJECT TITLE:
Automatic Datesheet Generation System

1. INTRODUCTION
The Automatic Datesheet Generation System is designed to automate the process
of creating examination schedules in a campus environment. The system reduces
manual effort, avoids exam clashes, and ensures efficient utilization of time
slots by generating a datesheet based on admin-provided academic information
and constraints.

2. PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM
The purpose of this system is to allow the administrator to gather all
necessary academic and examination details such as programs, years, subjects,
exam durations, and time slots, and automatically generate a valid and
clash-free datesheet.

3. STAKEHOLDERS
- Administrator (Examination Cell)
- Faculty Members
- Students

4. USER ROLES
4.1 Admin
- Enters academic structure (Programs, Years, Semesters)
- Enters exam-related information
- Defines constraints
- Approves and publishes datesheet

4.2 Faculty
- Views assigned exam schedules

4.3 Student
- Views and downloads datesheet

5. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

FR1: Admin Authentication
The system shall allow only authorized administrators to access the
datesheet generation module.

FR2: Academic Data Collection
The system shall allow the admin to enter:
- Programs (B.Tech, M.Tech, etc.)
- Academic years (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)
- Semesters
- Courses and subjects

FR3: Exam Data Entry
The system shall allow the admin to enter:
- Exam type (Mid-term, End-term)
- Exam duration
- Available time slots
- Exam dates range

FR4: Constraint Definition
The system shall allow the admin to define constraints such as:
- No overlapping exams for the same year/semester
- Minimum gap between exams
- Fixed exam duration per subject

FR5: Automatic Datesheet Generation
The system shall automatically generate a datesheet based on the provided
data and constraints.

FR6: Clash Detection and Resolution
The system shall detect exam clashes and automatically reassign time slots
until a valid datesheet is generated.

FR7: Datesheet Preview
The system shall allow the admin to preview the generated datesheet before
final approval.

FR8: Admin Approval
The system shall allow the admin to approve or reject the generated datesheet.

FR9: Publish Datesheet
The system shall publish the approved datesheet for faculty and students to
view.

FR10: View Datesheet
The system shall allow faculty and students to view the published datesheet
based on their role.

6. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

NFR1: Security
The system shall ensure secure login and role-based access.

NFR2: Performance
The system shall generate the datesheet within acceptable time limits.

NFR3: Reliability
The system shall generate a clash-free and consistent datesheet.

NFR4: Usability
The system shall provide an easy-to-use interface for admin and users.

NFR5: Scalability
The system shall support multiple programs, years, and semesters.

7. SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS
- The system shall use a relational (SQL) database.
- The system shall be web-based.
- The system shall be used within a campus environment.

8. ASSUMPTIONS
- Each subject has only one exam per academic session.
- Students belong to a single program and semester.
- All exam slots are predefined by the admin.

9. OUTPUT
The final output of the system is a valid, approved, and published exam
datesheet accessible to students and faculty.

10. CONCLUSION
The Automatic Datesheet Generation System improves efficiency, reduces human
error, and ensures a structured and conflict-free examination schedule.
